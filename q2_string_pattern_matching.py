# Question 2: String Pattern Matching
# You are given two strings: pattern and source. The first string pattern contains only the symbols 0 and 1, and the second string source contains only lowercase English letters.
#
# Your task is to calculate the number of substrings of source that match pattern. 
#
# We’ll say that a substring source[l..r] matches pattern if the following three conditions are met:
# – The pattern and substring are equal in length.
# – Where there is a 0 in the pattern, there is a vowel in the substring. 
# – Where there is a 1 in the pattern, there is a consonant in the substring. 
#
# Vowels are ‘a‘, ‘e‘, ‘i‘, ‘o‘, ‘u‘, and ‘y‘. All other letters are consonants.
#
# Example
#
# For pattern = "010" and source = "amazing", the output should be solution(pattern, source) = 2.
# – “010” matches source[0..2] = "ama". The pattern specifies “vowel, consonant, vowel”. “ama” matches this pattern: 0 matches a, 1 matches m, and 0 matches a. 
# – “010” doesn’t match source[1..3] = "maz" 
# – “010” matches source[2..4] = "azi" 
# – “010” doesn’t match source[3..5] = "zin" 
# – “010” doesn’t match source[4..6] = "ing"
#
# So, there are 2 matches. For a visual demonstration, see the example video. 
#
# For pattern = "100" and source = "codesignal", the output should be solution(pattern, source) = 0.
# – There are no double vowels in the string "codesignal", so it’s not possible for any of its substrings to match this pattern.
#
# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 ≤ source.length ≤ 103
# 1 ≤ pattern.length ≤ 103
# This is a pattern-matching question where instances of a pattern need to be found inside of a larger array. It has the advantage of testing several fundamental programming skills at once: traversing multiple arrays with nested loops, working with subarrays, and performing basic collections/string operations.
#
# Note that the guaranteed constraints in this question indicate that the candidate shouldn’t worry about optimizing their solution. 
source = "amazing"
pattern = "010"
vowels = "aeiouy"



#slice_size = len(pattern)

#start_index = id(source) % (len(source) - slice_size + 1)

#random_slice = source[start_index : start_index + slice_size]

    for i in range(len(source_bin)- pattern_len +1):
        current_slice = source_bin[i : i + pattern_len]
        
        if current_slice == pattern:
            count +=1

    return count
